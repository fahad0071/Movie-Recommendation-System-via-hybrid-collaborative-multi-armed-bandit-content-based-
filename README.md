# Movie Recommendation System via hybrid of Collaborative Multi armed bandit + Content based Filtering
This is a movie recommendation system implemented in Python that combines collaborative multi-armed bandit and content-based filtering techniques. The system suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical interactions.

## Features
Hybrid Recommendation Approach: The system leverages both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to provide accurate and diverse movie recommendations.
Collaborative Multi-Armed Bandit: The collaborative filtering component uses a multi-armed bandit algorithm to optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off and adaptively learn user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: The content-based filtering component analyzes the movie attributes such as genre, actors, and plot to recommend movies similar to the user's preferences.
User-Item Interaction Tracking: The system keeps track of user ratings and feedback to continuously update the recommendation model and improve accuracy over time.
Scalable and Efficient: The implementation is designed to handle large movie datasets efficiently, ensuring real-time recommendations even with a growing number of users and movies.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/fahad0071/mMovie-Recommendation-System-via-hybrid-collaborative-multi-armed-bandit-content-based-.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the movie dataset (e.g., MovieLens dataset) and place it in the data directory.

## Usage
Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the movie dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON) and contains the necessary attributes like movie ID, title, genre, and user ratings.

Configure the system: Adjust the system parameters, such as the number of recommendations to generate, the exploration factor for the multi-armed bandit algorithm, and the content-based filtering weights, according to your preferences and dataset characteristics.

Train the recommendation model: Run the training script to train the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models on your movie dataset. This step may take some time depending on the size of the dataset.

Generate movie recommendations: Once the training is complete, you can use the recommendation script to generate personalized movie recommendations for users. Provide the user ID or any relevant user information to obtain recommendations.
